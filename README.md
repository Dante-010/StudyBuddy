# StudyBuddy
This is a sample Android app that I made to try and get a feel of how trying to learn a new framework would be.

You can set objectives inside the app, with a starting and an ending date (eg: Read 60 pages from today to 10 days from now)
The app tells you, for example, how many pages per day you should read in order to achieve your goal in that set time.

This is not meant to be a real and fully working app, it's just a side project.
